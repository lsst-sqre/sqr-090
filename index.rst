System for collecting user feedback in Rubin documentation
##########################################################

.. abstract::

   A straightforward way to determine the effectiveness of documentation, and determine ways to improve that documentation, is to let our users tell us. This technote describes the architecture for a system for collecting feedback such as ratings and comments from Sphinx/Documenteer documentation sites published on ``lsst.io`` and storing that feedback for subsequent querying in Sasquatch/InfluxDB. Ook, the documentation librarian service, serves as an intermediary for safely receiving feedback submissions.
